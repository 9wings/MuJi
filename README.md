# comp20-f2018-team3

* Project Title:

* Problem Statement (i.e., what is the problem?)

* How do you solve the problem?

* List of all the features that your team will implement. Your team will 
* be held accountable for the featurs you list!

* What data will your prototype be using and collecting?

* Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary.

* Electronic mockups of what your team will be developing using wireframes. No
* hand-drawn mockups accepted. 

* If your team incorporates hardware into the project, a high-level system
* engineering diagram will be ideal. A high-level system engineering diagram
* contains all the compoments of the system (e.g., router, sensors, boards, 
* other hardware), how the components connect to other components, and inputs 
* and outputs (including data). Wireframes should still be used for system 
* engineering diagram. Wireframes of front-end web interfaces are still required.
