# comp20-f2018-team3

**Project Title:**
* MuJi

**By:**
* Anna Yuen
* Naoki Okada
* Titapa Chaiyakiturajai
* Manish Aryal

**What's Accomplished This Week**
* DeepAffects emotion API (sort of) works now! We were able to get an emotion
  back, though not entirely complete yet. 
* We got the audio file changed to base64 string.
* We linked the Spotify part of frontend and backend.
* The frontend plays a 30-second snippet of a song retuned based on a query.

**Challenges and Issues Faced**
* We're not getting anything sent back to our back end when trying to convert
  WAV file downloaded from our sit to base64. When we use the online conversion,
  curl works and we get an emotion back, but not when we try to do the 
  POST request ourselves. 
* Spotify authentication.

**Goals for Next Week**
* Finish up DeepAffects Emotions API.
* Finish up Spotify API.
